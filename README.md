# Overview
We'll be learning Python starting from the basics.

1. First, we'll be learning how to get Python running.
2. Second, we'll learn the fundamentals of the Command Line and the Python Interpreter.
3. Third, we'll get into the basics of programming, general concepts that can be applied to any programming language, and how to work the with Python programming language specifically.
4. Finally, we'll write a program to load and run computations on data.

By the end of the lesson, you should have a firm grasp on how Pyhon can be used to run computations

## Big Picture: Why does Python matter?
As a general programming tool, Python is a simple and useful general scripting language which can accomplish most anything you'd ever like to program.

Python's website says it best:
> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed. [\[source\]](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)

As a bioinformatics tool, Pyhon already has a widge range of free math, scientific libraries for analysis and data processing. These libraries should allow you to:
- Load and work with your own large data files
- Compute complex math
- Process and analyze RNA Sequencing data
- Run machine learning algorithms on your data

See the [Where to go from here?](#where-to-go-from-here) for some inspiration.

### Why should I use Python vs a spreadsheet application like Excel?
Let's address a common question: Why should I use Pyhon? Why wouldn't I just use Excel?

***The answer***: Don't stop using Excel! Pyhon is just a tool. We can use both for their strong points.

Python is a tool that can help solve problems of scale, automation and utility, and other pain points that might come along with large or complex datasets.

> A spreadsheet program will be better for entering new data and exploring existing data, using a mouse as a primary tool to explore and understand the data. Extending this exploration with simple transformations of small data is common.
>
> Python is great for a wide variety of data analysis. If the size of data is repeatably impacting your work, if your questions are getting too complex for a spreadsheet program to reasonable handle, or if there are alot of utility activities being done to handle the data, then Python becomes a useful tool.

# Installing Python
1. Go to <https://www.python.org/>
2. Navigate to Downloads: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
3. Download the latest version of Python 3.
  - Python 3 is also often referred to as Python 3.x, because there are many minor release versions. Python 2.x is an earlier version that is very popular but is being phased out over time. There are a few [key differences and breaking changes](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html) between Python 2 and Python 3.
  - Python 2 is still commonly supported for legacy applications and libraries. Even so, at this point [it's best to start with Python 3](http://www.asmeurer.com/blog/posts/moving-away-from-python-2/), since [almost all libraries support Python 3](http://py3readiness.org/).
4. Run the downloaded Python installer and go through the installation process for your OS.
    - Make sure that if the installer offers to add Python to your `PATH`, you agree. Otherwise, we will have to add the Python installation directory to the `PATH` it manually.
        - What's the `PATH`? The `PATH` environment variable is a list of locations your shell will check when you try to run a command in the command line. See [The Command Line](#the-command-line).

# The Command Line
The command line is the window for a programmer to access the heart of a computer.

Typical everyday applications using the mouse and on screen buttons are examples of a GUI (Graphical User Interface).

Instead of a GUI, the Command Line is a CLI (Command Line Interface). We'll be typing commands and hitting the Enter/Return key to send commands to the shell.

***Try it:*** Type in the following command into the command line
```shell
echo 'Programming is really cool, wow!'
```
Hit the Enter/Return key on the keyboard to send the command to the shell. You should observe the text being output right back at you.

```shell
george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~$ echo 'Programming is really cool, wow!'
Programming is really cool, wow!
```

Good job! You just ran a shell command very similar to how we'll be running Python scripts.

> **Note**:  We used single quotes, which prevent variable expansion, to let us type the exclamation mark `!` which has special meaning in the shell. Typically we'd want to use double quotes to let us do variable expansion like `echo "${USER}"`.

## Common Commands
Here are some absolutely essential CLI commands we'll be using.
- `echo`: Print/output to the command line
    - ***Try it:***
        ```shell
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~$ echo "User: $USER"
        User: george
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~$ echo "Home Directory: $HOME"
        Home Directory: /Users/george
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~$ echo "PATH variable: $PATH"
        PATH variable: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/george/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools:/Users/george/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/george/Library/Android/sdk/tools:/usr/local/share/npm/bin/:/Users/george/.rvm/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin
        ```
- `pwd`: "Print Working Directory"
    - Output the current working directory of the shell (where you currently are)
    - ***Try it:***
        ```shell
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~$ pwd
        /Users/george
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~$ cd python101/
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101$ pwd
        /Users/george/python101
        ```
    - Your current working directory will be printed in every one of your command prompts, making `pwd` redundant.
        - Within the prompt, you can find your current directory in between the `:` colon and the `$` dollar sign.
        - The `~` tilde character in your prompt is exactly equivalent to `$HOME`.
        - For example, in this prompt we can see we are in `python101` within the `$HOME` directory: `george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101$`
- `ls`: "List Segments" or more colloquially, just "list"
    - Show contents of a directory. With no arguments, `ls` will output the current working directory's contents.
    - ***Try it:***
        ```shell
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101$ ls
        LICENSE    README.md  code/      data/      sandbox/
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101$ ls sandbox/
        PEP20.txt     dir1/         dir2/         learnxiny.py  lorem.txt
        ```
- `cd`: "Change Directory"
    - Change the working directory by providing a relative or absolute path.
        - A *relative path* is based off of the current working directory, while an *absolute path* is based off the entire file system from the root of your computer. An example for `subdir1`:
            - Absolute Path: `/Users/george/python101/sandbox/dir1/subdir1`
            - Relative Path: With a working directory of `/Users/george/python101/`, a relative path to `subdir1` would be `sandbox/dir1/subdir1/`

                > **Note:** A trailing slash `/` means an item is definitely a directory, not a file (files cannot have a trailing slash). The trailing slash is optional.

            - In order to go upwards in the directory structure, `..` (two periods) means "*parent directory*".

    - ***Try it:***
        ```shell
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101$ cd sandbox
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101/sandbox$ ls
        PEP20.txt     dir1/         dir2/         learnxiny.py  lorem.txt
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101/sandbox$ ls dir1
        subdir1/ subdir2/
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101/sandbox$ cd dir1/subdir1
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101/sandbox/dir1/subdir1$ cd ..
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101/sandbox/dir1$ cd ../..
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101$
        ```
    - Given no argument, `cd` will return to the `$HOME` directory.
    ***Try it:***
        ```shell
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101$ cd
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~$
        ```
- `cat`: Short for "Concatenate"
    - View contents of a file, create single or multiple files, concatenate files, and redirect output in terminal or files
    - In practice, used for output to the screen, such as printing a whole file. `echo` doesn't print the contents of files, so instead we use `cat` for file output.
    - ***Try it:***
        ```shell
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101/sandbox$ ls
        PEP20.txt     dir1/         dir2/         learnxiny.py  lorem.txt
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101/sandbox$ cat PEP20.txt
        The Zen of Python

        Beautiful is better than ugly.
        Explicit is better than implicit.
        Simple is better than complex.
        Complex is better than complicated.
        Flat is better than nested.
        Sparse is better than dense.
        Readability counts.
        Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
        Although practicality beats purity.
        Errors should never pass silently.
        Unless explicitly silenced.
        In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
        There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
        Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
        Now is better than never.
        Although never is often better than *right* now.
        If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
        If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
        Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
        ```

    - `head` and `tail` commands print out files just like cat, but only output the first few lines or the last few lines respectively.

- `man`: "Manual"
    - Show manual documentation for the command given as an argument.
    - ***To exit:*** Once in the manual, press `q` to exit the manual.
    - ***Try it:***
        ```shell
        george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~$ man echo
        ECHO(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  ECHO(1)

        NAME
             echo -- write arguments to the standard output

        SYNOPSIS
             echo [-n] [string ...]

        DESCRIPTION
             The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank (` ') char-
             acters and followed by a newline (`\n') character, to the standard output.
         ...
        ```
    - Sometimes there's no man page. The command may have it's own `-h` or `--help` flag. Or you may have to Google for the documentation.

- Extra credit for the curious:
    - `env`: Display all environment variables
    - `compgen`: Can display available commands.
        - This is an example of a command without a `man` page, so look up the documentation for this on Google!
    - Searching Google for the answer is an essential tool.

# The Python Interpreter
Let's boot up python! Python can either interpret new commands one the fly or run scripts you've already written.
  - Writing commands on the fly in the interpreter is great for experimentation and prototyping new stuff.
  - Running pre-written scripts is much faster and easier to re-run the same funcionality. You don't have to type in the same thing twice!

Let's start with writing some commands on the fly with the Pyhon Intepreter, which from now on we'll just call "the interpreter".

## Starting the Interpreter
We'll start the interpreter in *the shell*, which depends on which operating system you're on.

In your command line enter `python3` if you're Unix, or `py` if you're Windows.
When the Python interpreter boots up, it should output some starting information for you. See the following Unix and Windows examples for what to expect.

### Unix (Mac Terminal, `BASH` Shell)
```shell
george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~$ python3
Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5050, Mar 21 2017, 01:21:04)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
### Windows (Command Prompt)
```shell
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

PS C:\Users\George> py
Python 2.7.13 (v2.7.13:a06454b1afa1, Dec 17 2016, 20:53:40) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> quit()
PS C:\Users\George> # Notice that it defaulted to python 2 if you have both installed. Oops! Let's do Python 3 instead.
PS C:\Users\George> py -3
Python 3.5.1 (v3.5.1:37a07cee5969, Dec  6 2015, 01:38:48) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

## How do I exit the interpreter?
If you're in the interpreter and you want to get out, use the Python `quit()` function and hit enter.
```Python
Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5050, Mar 21 2017, 01:21:04)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> quit()
george@testers-MacBook-Pro:~/python101$
```
Alternatively, you can close the entire terminal window, but that is closing the entire shell, not just the interpreter running *inside* the shell.

## Print
The `print()` statement will be your best friend while programming.
Do you want to show the user some output? `print()` it.
Want to debug why your programming isn't working? Go ahead and `print()` the value

## The Interpreter as a Calculator
Let's try a few different things we can do with the Interpreter, which can easily act as a calculator.

```
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> 4 - 15
-11
>>> 2 * 4
8
>>> 9 / 3
3.0

>>> (1 + 2.5) * .5
1.75
>>>
```

## Running Python Scripts
Let's run a Hello World script.

# Programming Fundamentals
Let's cover a few general concepts that every programming language has. These fundamental building blocks will allow us to build all possible programs.

- Data Types
- Expressions
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops

## Data Types
- Numbers
- Strings
- other types


## Expressions
Here are some expressions:
```
>>> 1
>>> "This string is an expression, albeit a simple one"
```

## Variables
## Conditionals
## Loops
## Data Structures
In order to compose

### Array
Arrays are *immutable*, ordered lists of like elements.

For example:
```python

```

### List
Lists are *mutable*


# Programming with Python
A highly recommended overview of how Python works can be found at [Learn Python in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/).

## Python Data Structures
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples

### Lists

## List Manipulation (Slicing)



## String formatting
https://pyformat.info/

## Reading from a file
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files
```python
>>> with open("data/biopsy.csv") as datafile:
...     datafile.read()
...
'"","ID","V1","V2","V3","V4","V5","V6","V7","V8","V9","class"\n"1","1000025",5,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,"benign"\n"2","1002945",5,4,4,5,7,10,3,2,1,"benign"\n
... # Output truncated
```

Reading the file like that. Let's just do one line at a time.
```python
>>> with open("data/biopsy.csv") as datafile:
...     for i in range(4):
...             datafile.readline()
...
'"","ID","V1","V2","V3","V4","V5","V6","V7","V8","V9","class"\n'
'"1","1000025",5,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,"benign"\n'
'"2","1002945",5,4,4,5,7,10,3,2,1,"benign"\n'
'"3","1015425",3,1,1,1,2,2,3,1,1,"benign"\n'
```
Notice that the newline character `\n` is kept in each line. Python detects that character as the end of a line, but leaves it for you to strip off yourself.

## Slicing Lists and Strings

## Reading a CSV File
https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/csv.html

```python
>>> import csv
>>> with open("data/biopsy.csv") as csvfile:
...     reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
...     for row in reader:
...             print(row)
...
['', 'ID', 'V1', 'V2', 'V3', 'V4', 'V5', 'V6', 'V7', 'V8', 'V9', 'class']
['1', '1000025', '5', '1', '1', '1', '2', '1', '3', '1', '1', 'benign']
['2', '1002945', '5', '4', '4', '5', '7', '10', '3', '2', '1', 'benign']
['3', '1015425', '3', '1', '1', '1', '2', '2', '3', '1', '1', 'benign']
... # Output truncated
```

# Let's Make Something
Now that we know how to do lots of cool things, let's program something real. Let's make a program which reads data from a CSV file and computes values from it.
