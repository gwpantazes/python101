# python_0x65 (Python 101)
Welcome to Python 0x65 (Python 101), a guided lesson for going from 0 to 101 in programming in Python.

We will be learning the basics of Python 3. This lesson will take about 2 hours. We'll cover absolute basics up through file reading. By the end, youâ€™ll be a pro in the fundamentals of Python!

# Installing Python
1. Go to https://www.python.org/
2. Go to Downloads: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Download the latest version of Python (Currently Python 3).
  - This is also often referred to as Python 3.x. Python 2.x is an earlier version that is very popular but is being phased out over time. There are a few [key differences and breaking changes](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html) between Python 2 and Python 3. 
  - Python 2 is still commonly supported for legacy applications and libraries. Even so, at this point [it's best to start with Python 3](http://www.asmeurer.com/blog/posts/moving-away-from-python-2/), since [almost all libraries support Python 3](http://py3readiness.org/).

# The Command Line
The command line is where the real work gets done. It is the window for a programmer to access the heart of a computer.

The Command Line is a CLI (Command Line Interface) as opposed to a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Typing will get you everywhere. Your mouse pointer won't help you here.

## Getting around
Here are some absolutely essential 


- `pwd`: "Print Working Directory"
- `ls`: "List Segments" or more colloquially, just "list"
- `cd`: "Change Directory"
- `man`: "Manual"

# The Python Interpreter
Let's boot up python! In your command line enter `python3` if you're Unix, or `py` if you're Windows.
When the Python interpreter boots up, it should output some starting information for you.

```
george@testers-MBP:~$ python3
Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5050, Mar 21 2017, 01:21:04) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```
## How do I exit the interpreter?
In order to `quit()` the interpreter, at the command prompt, type
```
>>> quit()
```
Alternatively, you can close the entire terminal window, but that is closing the entire shell, not just the interpreter running *inside* the shell.

## Print
The `print()` statement will be your best friend while programming.
Do you want to show the user some output? `print()` it.
Want to debug why your programming isn't working? Go ahead and `print()` the value 

## The Interpreter as a Calculator
Let's try a few different things we can do with the Interpreter, which can easily act as a calculator.

```
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> 4 - 15
-11
>>> 2 * 4
8
>>> 9 / 3
3.0

>>> (1 + 2.5) * .5
1.75
>>> 
```

# Programming Fundamentals
Let's cover a few general concepts that every programming language has. These fundamental building blocks will allow us to build all possible programs.

- Data Types
- Expressions
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops

## Data Types
## Expressions
Here are some expressions:
```
>>> 1
>>> "This string is an expression, albeit a simple one"
```
## Variables
## Conditionals
## Loops

# Programming with Python
## Reading from a file
## String slicing

# Reading a CSV File

# Let's Make Something
Now that we know how to do lots of cool things, let's program something real. Let's make a program which reads data from a CSV file and computes values from it.

# Where to Go From Here?
Python has extensive libraries for Scientific Analysis and Computation.
  - NumPy: A library for computation
  - SciPy: A library for scientific computation
  - RNASEQ: Compute RNA Sequences using Python.
